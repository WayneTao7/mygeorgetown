However, they are also frequent targets of violent attacks. According to the Aid Worker Security Database (AWSD), a record 281 aid workers were killed in the line of duty worldwide in 2024.</p></section> <section class="section svelte-1fionif"><h2 class="title svelte-1fionif">Where Do Most Attacks Occur?</h2> <p class="subtitle svelte-1fionif">This global map highlights the countries where aid workers have been most frequently attacked.</p> <p class="tip svelte-1fionif">Hint: Hover over each country to see the number of incidents.</p> <svg class="svelte-1fionif"></svg> <div class="legend svelte-1fionif"><span class="svelte-1fionif"><span class="legend-box darkest svelte-1fionif"></span> Highest</span> <span class="svelte-1fionif"><span class="legend-box dark svelte-1fionif"></span> High</span> <span class="svelte-1fionif"><span class="legend-box medium svelte-1fionif"></span> Medium</span> <span class="svelte-1fionif"><span class="legend-box light svelte-1fionif"></span> Low</span> <span class="svelte-1fionif"><span class="legend-box none svelte-1fionif"></span> No Data</span></div> <p class="caption svelte-1fionif">Note: This map reflects reported major incidents from the AWSD dataset. Countries with darker shades indicate more incidents. The data may underreport attacks in regions with weak media presence.</p></section> <section class="section svelte-1fionif"><h2 class="title svelte-1fionif">Where Do Most Attacks Occur?</h2> <p class="subtitle svelte-1fionif">The map reveals a disturbing concentration of attacks in a few regions. By far, the most dangerous countries for aid workers are located in Africa and the Middle East.</p> <p class="body svelte-1fionif">According to the map, countries like South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Somalia, Afghanistan, and Syria reported the highest number of violent incidents against humanitarian personnel in recent years. These regions are characterized by ongoing armed conflict, political instability, and limited rule of law—factors that create hostile conditions not only for civilians but also for those trying to help them.</p> <p class="body svelte-1fionif">In contrast, large portions of the Americas, Asia, and Europe report relatively few attacks—or none at all. While this doesn't mean aid workers are completely safe in these places, it suggests a correlation between geopolitical instability and aid worker insecurity.</p> <p class="body svelte-1fionif">By visualizing these hotspots, we emphasize a sobering truth: the areas that need help most are often the ones where helping is most dangerous. This calls for not only increased protection and planning for humanitarian operations, but also greater international focus on the root causes of these conflicts.</p> <section class="section svelte-1fionif"><h2 class="title svelte-1fionif">Different Countries, Different Cost</h2> <p class="subtitle svelte-1fionif">This chart shows the average number of victims per attack, by country.</p> <svg id="svg12" class="svelte-1fionif"></svg> <p class="caption svelte-1fionif">Note: Some countries not only experience frequent attacks but also endure heavier consequences per incident. High averages often reflect complex, violent incidents like bombings or mass shootings.</p></section> <section class="section svelte-1fionif"><h2 class="title svelte-1fionif">Different Countries, Different Cost</h2> <p class="subtitle svelte-1fionif">Some countries not only face more attacks—but each attack tends to be more deadly.</p> <p class="body svelte-1fionif">The chart reveals a troubling reality: while countries like South Sudan and Somalia are frequently listed in attack counts, they also top the list when it comes to the **average number of victims per incident**. In South Sudan, for instance, many assaults involve the mass shooting of entire aid teams. In Somalia and Afghanistan, IED attacks and group kidnappings are common, leading to disproportionately high casualty numbers.</p> <p class="body svelte-1fionif">This pattern suggests a deeper layer of risk. In these high-threat countries, attackers often use **more coordinated and destructive tactics**—from ambushes on convoys to multi-victim bombings. These aren't isolated random events; they reflect deliberate targeting, often against high-visibility international agencies. It also implies that simply counting incidents misses a crucial dimension of humanitarian risk: the **intensity** of violence.</p> <p class="body svelte-1fionif">By analyzing per-incident severity, we highlight the urgency for context-specific protections. In places where each attack is devastating, aid missions must consider reducing group exposure, improving threat intelligence, and prioritizing rapid-response protocols. The future of humanitarian aid in these regions depends not only on quantity of response, but on its quality and security depth.</p></section> <section class="section svelte-1fionif"><h2 class="title svelte-1fionif">How Have Attacks Evolved Over Time?</h2> <p class="subtitle svelte-1fionif">This interactive chart shows the number of reported major attacks on aid workers each year over the past two decades.</p> <svg class="svelte-1fionif"></svg> <p class="caption svelte-1fionif">Note: The line highlights major increases and drops in aid worker incidents over time. Significant spikes often align with known conflicts such as the Syrian Civil War or escalations in Afghanistan.</p></section> <section class="section svelte-1fionif"><h2 class="title svelte-1fionif">How Have Attacks Evolved Over Time?</h2> <p class="subtitle svelte-1fionif">The temporal pattern of attacks reveals not just data—but a narrative of escalating danger for aid workers.</p> <p class="body svelte-1fionif">The line chart shows a troubling long-term escalation of violence against humanitarian workers. While minor fluctuations are expected year to year, the overall trend line clearly slopes upward. Notably, spikes around 2013 and again after 2018 mark periods of intensified conflict. These moments coincide with global events such as the Syrian Civil War, the Taliban resurgence in Afghanistan, and instability across the Sahel.</p> <p class="body svelte-1fionif">What’s particularly alarming is the all-time high reached in 2024—with over 350 reported attacks. This is not just a statistical anomaly; it reflects real-world flashpoints like the armed conflict in Sudan, the Gaza humanitarian crisis, and rising insecurity in Haiti. Aid workers are increasingly operating in hostile environments where they are directly targeted.</p> <p class="body svelte-1fionif">This page isn’t just about counting attacks—it’s about understanding what those numbers signify. The rising trend points to a global system under strain. As international law and humanitarian protections erode, neutral aid missions are being seen less as impartial and more as political targets. This erosion puts both workers and civilians at risk.</p> <p class="body svelte-1fionif">The data underscores a pressing need: the global community must invest not only in protective infrastructure for NGOs and UN bodies, but also in long-term political solutions that address root causes of instability. Without such action, the numbers on this timeline will continue to climb—and so will the toll on humanitarian lives.</p></section> <section class="section svelte-1fionif"><h2 class="title svelte-1fionif">Who Gets Targeted Most?</h2> <p class="subtitle svelte-1fionif">This stacked bar chart compares local and international aid workers across different organization types.</p> <svg class="svelte-1fionif"></svg> <div class="legend7 svelte-1fionif"><div class="svelte-1fionif"><span class="legend-box svelte-1fionif" style="background-color:#e45756;"></span> National Staff</div> <div class="svelte-1fionif"><span class="legend-box svelte-1fionif" style="background-color:#4c78a8;"></span> International Staff</div></div> <p class="caption svelte-1fionif">The bars represent the number of victims within each organization, separated by nationality: local vs international.</p> <p class="body svelte-1fionif">The data reveals a crucial insight: <strong class="svelte-1fionif">local (national) staff face the majority of violence</strong>, especially within national NGOs and even international organizations like the UN or ICRC.
		While international workers are often perceived as higher-value targets, national staff are far more exposed due to their continued presence in high-risk areas even after international evacuations.</p></section> <section class="section svelte-1fionif"><h2 class="title svelte-1fionif">Who Gets Targeted Most?</h2> <p class="subtitle svelte-1fionif">The chart reveals a critical disparity in the risks faced by aid workers across different organizations and nationalities.</p> <p class="body svelte-1fionif">The data shows that <strong class="svelte-1fionif">national staff consistently suffer the majority of attacks</strong>, particularly within local NGOs (NNGOs), but also across international NGOs (INGOs) and UN-affiliated missions. This is especially striking in the case of INGOs, where national staff account for a substantial share of victims—demonstrating their outsized exposure to danger on the ground.</p> <p class="body svelte-1fionif">While international staff may be viewed as higher-value targets in some contexts, they are generally afforded stronger protection and are more likely to be relocated during escalating crises. In contrast, <strong class="svelte-1fionif">national workers remain embedded in local operations</strong>, often without the same evacuation resources or security protocols, which amplifies their vulnerability.</p> <p class="body svelte-1fionif">This disparity raises important questions about the global humanitarian system’s reliance on national staff to operate in the most dangerous areas. It underscores the need for <strong class="svelte-1fionif">greater investment in local staff safety, training, insurance, and post-incident care</strong>. Without such support, the burden of humanitarian risk remains unjustly uneven.</p></section> <section class="section svelte-1fionif"><h2 class="title svelte-1fionif">How Are Aid Workers Attacked?</h2> <p class="subtitle svelte-1fionif">This horizontal bar chart shows the most common methods of attack against aid workers.</p> <svg id="svg9" class="svelte-1fionif"></svg> <p class="caption svelte-1fionif">Hint: Hover over each bar to see the number of incidents.</p></section> <section class="section svelte-1fionif"><h2 class="title svelte-1fionif">What Are the Most Common Forms of Violence?</h2> <p class="body svelte-1fionif">The data reveals that <strong class="svelte-1fionif">shootings</strong> remain the most common form of attack on aid workers, followed by <strong class="svelte-1fionif">kidnappings</strong> and <strong class="svelte-1fionif">bodily assaults</strong>. These methods represent targeted, often opportunistic violence—indicating that aid workers are frequently caught in active conflict zones without adequate protective measures.</p> <p class="body svelte-1fionif">While less frequent, <strong class="svelte-1fionif">complex attacks</strong>—those involving combinations of tactics like IEDs, armed assault, and kidnapping—suggest a growing operational sophistication among hostile groups. These incidents are especially concerning as they imply premeditated, coordinated efforts to harm or obstruct humanitarian personnel.</p> <p class="body svelte-1fionif">The variety of means—from traditional explosives to sexual assault—underscores the diverse dangers aid workers face on the ground. Protection strategies must therefore be tailored not only to the location, but also to the evolving nature of threats in each operational context.</p></section> <section class="section svelte-1fionif"><h2 class="title svelte-1fionif">Where Do Attacks Happen?</h2> <p class="subtitle svelte-1fionif">This waffle chart shows where aid workers are most commonly attacked.</p> <div id="waffle11" class="svelte-1fionif"></div> <p class="caption svelte-1fionif">Note: The most dangerous location is often transit—suggesting that the journey between aid sites is more dangerous than the sites themselves.</p></section> <section class="section svelte-1fionif"><h2 class="title svelte-1fionif">Which Locations Are the Most Dangerous?</h2> <p class="body svelte-1fionif">According to the data, <strong class="svelte-1fionif">the most dangerous place for aid workers is not the project site, but the road</strong>. Transit routes account for the highest number of attacks, exposing a vulnerability in mobility and logistics.</p> <p class="body svelte-1fionif">While project sites and offices are also common places for attacks, their numbers are lower—possibly due to better coordination and visibility at fixed locations. Attacks at home, though rarer, point to deeply personal targeting, often in contexts of ongoing threats.</p> <p class="body svelte-1fionif">This trend highlights the need for enhanced security planning not just at work sites, but during movement between them. Checkpoints, vehicle ambushes, and roadside IEDs present major hazards, and mitigation strategies must adapt accordingly.</p></section> <section class="section svelte-1fionif"><h2 class="title svelte-1fionif">What Don’t We Know?</h2> <p class="subtitle svelte-1fionif">Behind every dataset lies uncertainty. This one is no different.</p> <p class="body svelte-1fionif">While the Aid Worker Security Database (AWSD) is the most comprehensive public record of major attacks on humanitarian personnel, it still reflects significant <strong class="svelte-1fionif">gaps in visibility</strong>. Some aid organizations may underreport incidents due to reputational concerns, internal policy, or fear of retaliation. Others may use different classification standards—for example, what one agency labels “armed robbery,” another may count as “abduction.”</p> <p class="body svelte-1fionif">Many records contain vague or missing information. Fields like location, perpetrator identity, or victim nationality are frequently marked as <strong class="svelte-1fionif">“Unknown.”</strong> This isn’t due to negligence, but rather the <strong class="svelte-1fionif">chaotic nature of conflict zones</strong>. In some cases, aid workers disappear without trace; in others, no witness survives to provide details.</p> <p class="body svelte-1fionif">These data limitations don’t invalidate our findings—but they do remind us to interpret them with **humility and caution**. The charts show us what we know. But perhaps more importantly, they hint at what we don't.</p> <p class="caption svelte-1fionif" style="font-style: italic; margin-top: 2rem;">🕳️ What we can see is already alarming. But what about what we can’t?</p></section> <section class="section svelte-1fionif"><h2 class="title svelte-1fionif">Beyond the Data: What Should Be Done?</h2> <p class="subtitle svelte-1fionif">The numbers are clear. The path forward demands action.</p> <p class="body svelte-1fionif">This data story has revealed uncomfortable truths: <strong class="svelte-1fionif">Aid workers are being attacked more frequently</strong>, in more diverse locations, using more complex methods. These attacks disproportionately affect <strong class="svelte-1fionif">national staff</strong>, who face the greatest risk while receiving the least recognition or protection.</p> <p class="body svelte-1fionif">We’ve seen how <strong class="svelte-1fionif">armed conflict zones like Syria, Afghanistan, and Sudan</strong> are not only hotspots of humanitarian crisis—but also of humanitarian danger. The <strong class="svelte-1fionif">means and locations</strong> of attacks suggest that even routine travel or office work can carry lethal risk. And the <strong class="svelte-1fionif">gaps in data</strong> highlight how much may still go unseen.</p> <div class="body svelte-1fionif" style="max-width: 720px; margin: 1rem auto; text-align: left;"><ul class="svelte-1fionif"><li class="svelte-1fionif">🔒 <strong class="svelte-1fionif">Improve security protocols</strong> for frontline staff—especially nationals.</li> <li class="svelte-1fionif">📊 <strong class="svelte-1fionif">Standardize reporting practices</strong> across aid organizations.</li> <li class="svelte-1fionif">🌍 <strong class="svelte-1fionif">Strengthen international protections</strong> for humanitarian personnel under international law.</li> <li class="svelte-1fionif">🕊️ <strong class="svelte-1fionif">Address root causes of violence</strong>—because true safety requires peace.</li></ul></div> <p class="caption svelte-1fionif" style="margin-top: 2rem; font-style: italic;">Data alone can’t stop the violence.
